# Foodscape

I created an app for a food ordering platform to enable users order for healthy meals irrespective of location.
The application is designed to allows users to easily order fresh, healthy dishes from restaurants around them with the use of Expo React Native.
The features include:
- Sign Up, Login, Logout and Forgot password with Firebase
- Adding to Cart
- Adding Address for home delivery
- Adding the Payment Card, either Mastercard or Visa
- Checking out Orders
- Screen for both Food and Snacks.
